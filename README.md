## :bulb: What is the idea behind this project?



## :open_book: How can I contribute ?

At the bottom of this file, you'll find a task list to easily view where the project stands at.

If you are a contributor and you want to start adding some code follow this procedure (this is using the CLI/Terminal/Command Interface):
The following steps will assume that you are using the Windows Command Line.

1. Clone the repository

> Navigate to the folder in which you want to store this project then write `git clone https://github.com/PierreMrt/job_scraper.git`. To enter the created folder, use `cd job_scraper`.

2. Create a pip environment with virtualenv

> Because we are using python and to assure compatibility between contributors, we use virtualenv. First, check that virtualenv is installed by writing `virtualenv` in your command line. If it doesn't recognise it, simply install it with `pip install virtualenv`. Then create your environement with `virtualenv env_VERSION_OF_PYTHON`. Replace VERSION_OF_PYTHON with your current Python version. Check it with `py --version`.

3. Enter the pip environment with virtualenv

> To use it, enter the following line in your terminal `env_VERSION_OF_PYTHON\Scripts\activate`. You should see (env_3_9_2) at the left of the current folder position `(env_VERSION_OF_PYTHON) C:\Users\JohnDoe\code\job_scrapper>`.

4. Install all pip dependencies

> If you check what files are currently sitting in the repo, you'll find `requirements.txt`. This files tells pip what dependencies to install with a version attached to it. To install all dependencies simply write `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

> I need to install a python library, how do it do it?

First, check that you are under the project's pip environment (in the terminal, you should have (env_3_9_2) at the left of your current foler position). Then, just run `pip install <your-library>`. It should be installed for the whole project. To know which version of the package you have write `pip freeze` and copy/paste the returned result in `requirements.txt`.
